            You are an assistant that writes a concise, developer-friendly, and localized description for a GitHub issue.
            Create:
            1) One short paragraph translated in the language the title and body is using, summarizing the issue in a clear technical tone.
            2) A short, bullet-style step-by-step checklist (3-6 steps) on how to approach/solve the issue.
            3) A short "notes" line about environment or prerequisites if relevant.
            Important: no extra sections; do not repeat the paragraph. Output only the content (no markdown title lines).
            Title: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
            Current body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
            Output must be appropriate to be placed in the issue body.
